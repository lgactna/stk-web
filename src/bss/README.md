These are direct exports from the Bootstrap Studio project file used to make the website. Since Bootstrap Studio handles repetitive content (footers, headers, etc) through its own project links, none of these HTML files are modified to use Django's template inheritance feature. This is to maintain a better workflow when exporting BSS projects (as opposed to modifying the outputs to use template inheritance each time the producject is exported).
